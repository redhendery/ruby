# Accountability Group Creator!

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes

## Summary
In this challenge, you are going to make a method that takes an array of names (you'll want to make a list from the people in your cohort) and outputs a list of accountability groups for three different units. You should try to get everyone into an accountability group of 4, but it's your decision how to deal with cohorts not easily divisible by four. Make sure to check out the Ruby docs to see if there are any built-in methods that can help you.

This is a creative challenge and you can make it as easy or difficult as you would like. Here are some questions to consider when deciding how to build this:

- If you run this program three times in a row, will the program give you three different outputs?
- Should the program store past outputs?
- If one person were to leave the cohort, how would the accountability groups change?
- How do you decide when you're done? You'll need to decide. This is much more challenging than you probably think, especially since there are no pre-written tests.
