# Create a Method to Pad an Array

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Research and use Ruby methods
- Differentiate between and produce destructive and non-destructive methods

## Summary:
Implement two new methods `pad` and `pad!`. Each method accepts an array, a minimum size (non-negative integer) for the array, and an optional pad value as arguments.

If the array's length is less than the minimum size, `pad` should return a new array padded with the pad value up to the minimum size.

For example,
```ruby
pad([1,2,3], 5)
```

should return

```ruby
[1,2,3,nil,nil]
```

And

```ruby
pad([1,2,3], 5, 'apple')
```

should return

```ruby
[1,2,3,'apple', 'apple']
```

If the minimum size is less than or equal to the length of the array, it should just return the array.

That is, `pad([1,2,3], 3)` should return `[1,2,3]`.

`pad(my_array, 0)` should always return an array equal to `my_array`. `pad` should also always return a new object, so it should be non-destructive.

`pad!` behaves identically to `pad` except that it modifies the original array.

We took you through the coding process in the last challenge. From now on, we will use these links to outline the coding process for each challenge. It is required that you complete each non-optional release.

## Release 0: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 1: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

## Release 2: Run the tests
Once your code passes the tests, move on to refactoring.

## Release 3: [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) your solution
Make sure your code still passes the tests!

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 5: Commit and Push!
If you want feedback, continue using Slack and G+ to request it!
