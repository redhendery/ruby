# Calculate a Letter Grade

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Research and use Ruby methods

## Summary:
Create a method `get_grade` that accepts an `Array` of test scores.  Each score in the array should be between `0` and `100`, where
`100` is the max score.

Compute the average score and return the letter grade as a `String`, i.e., `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'D'`, or `'F'`.

For example:

```ruby
# How studious!
get_grade([100, 100, 100]) # => 'A'
```
