# Week 5: Algorithms

Last week you built up a toolkit of ruby methods. You practiced with them and gained a good intuition of how they work, what they're used for, and so on. This week you'll use that toolkit to solve some more complex problems.

## To-Do
1. Fork and clone this repo ([reminder instructions](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-week-1/blob/master/git_practice/README.md))
2. [Add It Up](./1-add-it-up)
3. [Pad An Array](./2-pad-array)
4. [Calculate the Mode](./3-calculate-mode)
5. [Calculate a Letter Grade](./calculate-letter-grade)
6. [Calculate the Median](./calculate-median)
7. [Research Methods](./4-research-methods)
8. [Separate Numbers with Commas](./5-nums-commas-solo-challenge)
[Create Accountability Groups](./6-acct-groups)

#### Everyday
- Practice touch typing in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript / jQuery with [typing.io](https://typing.io). You should be past 40wpm by the end of phase zero.
- Study + practice sublime text shortcuts [Mac](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/sublime-text-2/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_osx.html)/[Windows/Linux](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/sublime-text-2/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_win.html),
- Study + practice [terminal commands](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

## 3. Submit your work
If you need, you can review [these guidelines](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/submission-guidelines.md) on submitting challenges.
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/PTNmDL8Lnv) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.

**if you do not finish by the deadline:**

- Complete an extension request by emailing your facilitator. (There are a limited number of extensions available during phase-0)
- When complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/PTNmDL8Lnv)
