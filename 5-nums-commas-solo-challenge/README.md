# Separate Numbers with Commas [Solo Challenge](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/solo-challenges.md)

## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Research and use Ruby methods
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes

## Summary
Write a method `separate_comma` which takes an integer as its input and returns a comma-separated integer as a string. Like this:

```ruby
separate_comma(1000)    # => "1,000"
separate_comma(1000000) # => "1,000,000"
separate_comma(0)       # => "0"
separate_comma(100)     # => "100"
```

*NOTE: Even if you are comfortable with regular expressions, do not use them in this challenge. It's all about the logic!*

You have some RSpec for this. It's saved in your `my_solutions` directory. If you can think of any specific cases the RSpec doesn't cover, see if you can write tests using [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md) that tests the missing case. Keep it simple!

Also make sure you complete each challenge component. You will receive feedback on this challenge, and they will review each release.

## Release 0: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 1: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

Make sure it passes the spec tests before refactoring.

## Release 2: [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md) Your solution

Be sure it still passes the tests!

## Release 3: [Reflect](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)


## Release 4: Commit and push
Commit your changes and push your solution to Github
