# Calculate the Median


## Learning Competencies
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Implement a method based on pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Research and use Ruby methods


## Summary:

Write a method `median` which takes an `Array` of numbers as its input and returns the median value.

You might want to look up the definition of "median."

For example:

```ruby
median([1,2,3])      # => 2
median([4.5, 0, -1]) # => 0
median([-100, 100])  # => 0.0
```

Once you get the `Array` of numbers passing the tests, try to find the median of an array of strings.
In this case, your method should return the word between the other words alphabetically.

```ruby
median(["apple","cherry","banana"])      # => "banana"
```
